<HTML><BODY>This economics classic is (to my amazement) not yet in Project Gutenberg. Here presented is a 1806 re-issue of the text (which was first published in two parts in 1714 and 1729). Although scans of older editions can be found on-line (and also a copyright-restricted proofread <a href="http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/846">text version</a> of this work), I've chosen this edition because it is far more readable than the older scans. Still at time, you will encounter some black stains, and the text might be more easy to discern from the scans used at <a href="https://archive.org/details/fableofbees00mand">TIA</a>.

<p>The text uses the old-style long s (&#383;), which looks like a letter f, but with the little horizontal stroke either being not present at all, or just on the left side of the stem. Please proofread it as a normal s. Some words will require some special care, for example: the words <code>&#383;ee</code> and <code>fee</code> are very similar: the former should be proofread as <code>see</code>, while the latter should remain <code>fee</code>. I will add such easily confused words to the bad-words list. Please do not modernize old spelling or grammar conventions otherwise, but indicate any apparent typographical error as follows: <code>mistake[**typo: correction]</code>.

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fable_of_the_Bees">Wikipedia</a>:

<blockquote>The <i>Fable of The Bees: or, Private Vices, Public Benefits</i> is a book by Bernard Mandeville, consisting of the poem, <i>The Grumbling Hive: or, Knaves turn’d Honest</i>, along with prose discussion of the poem. The poem was published in 1705, and the book first appeared in 1714. The poem suggests many key principles of economic thought, including division of labor and the "invisible hand", seventy years before these concepts were more thoroughly elucidated by Adam Smith. Two centuries later, the noted economist John Maynard Keynes cited Mandeville to show that it was "no new thing ... to ascribe the evils of unemployment to ... the insufficiency of the propensity to consume", a condition also known as the paradox of thrift, which was central to his own theory of effective demand.

<p>At the time, however, it was considered scandalous. Keynes noted that it was "convicted as a nuisance by the grand jury of Middlesex in 1723, which stands out in the history of the moral sciences for its scandalous reputation. Only one man is recorded as having spoken a good word for it, namely Dr. Johnson, who declared that it did not puzzle him, but 'opened his eyes into real life very much'."</blockquote>
